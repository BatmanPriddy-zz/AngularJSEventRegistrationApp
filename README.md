# AngularJS Event Registration App 

Welcome fellow GitHub superstar!

This demo demonstrates a realistic single page AngularJS application. Feel free to clone this repository and modify in any way you'd like.

The corresponding Pluralsight tutorial for this demo can be found [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angularjs-fundamentals/table-of-contents).

### Tools/Frameworks

* WebStorm 11.0.3 (IDE)
* Node.js (Version 4.3.1)
* AngularJS (Version 1.4)
* JSON (Format for event data)
* Bootstrap (Version 2.3.1, for page layout)
* Font Awesome (Version 4.5, for page icons)

If you don't have the WebStorm IDE already installed, you may download the free 30-day trial [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

Two Servers implementations are provided:

* ASP.NET MVC server
* Node.js server

If using the ASP.NET server, simply start it up in IIS. 
If using the Node.js server and you don't have the runtime already installed, you may download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To start the Node.js server, perform the following steps:

1. Open the WebStorm Terminal (if not open already), by typing `Alt + F12`.
2. Depending on your OS, you may run either of the following commmands:
2a. If you are using Windows, enter `./server.bat`
2b. If you are using Linux, enter `./server.sh`

### Running the application

Once either the ASP.NET MVC Server or Node.js server are started, navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/EventDetails.html` to see the app running in your browser of choice.

**TODO**

1. Create custom directives for use with this demo app.
2. Test the AngularJS code.
3. Publish web application to free Azure account.

Happy AngularJSing!
